Welcome to my personal site where I've compiled various articles discussing things I've figured out. I rely heavily on blog posts/articles when I am working on a project
so I felt like I should write some posts about the various projects I work on from time to time. I hope these articles will be of use to other people who want to take on 
a similar task. I use this as a place to record my process and document some of
the projects I work on. The projects vary from cooking to mathematics - pretty much anything I feel is worthy of recording once I finish it. Sometimes its a tutorial
and sometimes its just a discussion of an interesting topic.
