Hi I'm Tanner and this is a place where I share my thoughts. 

I am a movement artist and have degrees in phyiscs and mathematics.

As I write this I am in my second to last semester of an MS Physics program. I first found a love for science in my highschool chemistry class and knew I wanted to learn more. I went into my undergraduate program as a chemistry major but very quickly switched to physics because I felt it covered more worldly phenomena than chemistry (and my girlfriend was doing physics as well). I added math as a degree after my first semester due to some inspiration from my Calc 1 professor (my favorite professor of all time) and a bit of convincing from a fellow physics/math student. During my time as both an undergrad and grad student I tried out multiple research projects to see what area I might want to go into but above all else I connected most with teaching. I have been teaching an undergrad lab class for the last four semesters and have discovered my love and passion for teaching.

On the flip side of my life (pun intended) I have been involved in movement of many different forms for quite some time. I was flipping and throwing myself around on couch cusions and pads since I was little. I started in parkour/freerunning almost 9 years ago then transitioned to gymnastics. First I competed Trampoline and Tumbling (though mostly trampoline) but I switched to Mens Gymnastics when I went to college. After college I moved to LA and since have returned to my parkour roots in addition to picking up tricking. Throughout most of this process I have been working to become a stunt performer, a childhood dream of mine. I am still in the very early stages of a career in stunts but I have loved every bit of it and have no intention of stopping anytime soon.

I am trying out this blog to see if writing online and sharing my thoughts and things I've learned can have a positive effect on myself and others. I don't have a specific plan for the content on this site - I just plan on writing about things I am interested in or have learned something about. This could range from specific topics in science/math to how I look at the world through the lens of physics to why I started movement to how I am working through tearing my achillies tendon (just able to walk without a boot at the time of writing this) or something completely different.

I am not sure how this will go or if you as a reader will find any value in the articles I write, but if you do I would love to hear about it. Reach out to me on socials (below) or send me an email!
